# Orca Frontend

Orca Frontend is a modern web application built using SvelteKit, designed to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. This project leverages the latest web technologies, including Tailwind CSS for styling, Vite for an optimized build process, and Zod for schema validation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v18.18.1 as specified in `.tool-versions`)
- npm 

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OladetounJed/orca-frontend
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd orca-frontend
   ```
3. Install the dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts a local server and opens the application in your default web browser. The development server provides hot reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you develop.
